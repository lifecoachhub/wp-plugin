Connect your WordPress site to your coaching business. Manage clients, sessions, and courses from your WordPress dashboard.

== Description ==

## Mission & Problem

Coaching today means juggling too many tools â€” separate platforms for scheduling, billing, forms, online courses, client records, and digital products. This leaves coaches spending more time managing tech than serving clients.

With Life Coach Hub, you already have a complete coaching platform. Now, our official WordPress plugin lets you bring all that power into your WordPress site.

No more scattered logins. No more disconnected systems. Just your coaching business, all in one place.

## What It Does

With this plugin, you can:

* Log into your Life Coach Hub dashboard directly from WordPress â€” no more switching tabs or re-entering credentials
* Manage clients, sessions, courses, digital products, and payments â€” all from one integrated coaching backend
* Assign tools, take notes, track progress, and engage clients with session forms, notes, plans, goals and journalingâ€” directly inside your LCH account
* Access the full Coaching Success Stack â€” your scheduling, automation, and business growth tools, now just one click away

## How It Works (Step-by-Step Setup)

**Step 1: Install the Plugin**
Find "Life Coach Hub" in the WP Plugin Directory, install, and activate.

**Step 2: Connect Your Account**
Log into your Life Coach Hub account (or register). The plugin will auto-sync with your dashboard.

**Step 3: Start Coaching**
Manage your clients, launch digital offers, assign coaching tools, and track progressâ€”all from inside your WordPress site.

## Who It's For

This plugin is built for:

* Coaches who want everything in one place
* Coaches who are tired of switching between a dozen tools
* Coaches ready to scale with systems that do the heavy lifting

## What You Can Do With It

Imagine a coach who runs her business through WordPress. She wants to:

* Schedule sessions and let clients self-book
* Accept payments directly via Stripe
* Automate onboarding with welcome packages and agreements
* Track client goals, session notes, and progress in one place
* Assign interactive coaching tools, worksheets, and journals
* Show tangible progress to boost retention and referrals
* Create and sell digital products from her own storefront
* Offer and run courses with built-in engagement features
* Offer lead magnets like free downloads, trials, or consultations to grow her list
* Manage it all without switching between tools

Now she can. The LCH plugin connects it all.

## Why This is Different

Unlike general automation platforms, this plugin isn't trying to duct tape together random tools. It connects directly to a platform built specifically for coaches, with tested tools and templates that save time, grow income, and increase impact.

No Zapier. No Frankenstein systems. Just seamless, professional coaching workflows.

## Performance & Reliability You Can Count On

You don't have to worry about maintenance, security, or performance. The Life Coach Hub app is hosted on our dedicated, high-speed servers, engineered and monitored by our development team for maximum reliability.

No updates to manage, no plugins to babysit â€” just a smooth, secure experience every time you log in.
